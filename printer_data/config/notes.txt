ToDo:
Im thinking... Change out the camera hardware to resolve white balance..


Notes:
So, shaketune.. didnt work because the docs said nothing about adding [shaketune] to printer.cfg (or an associated file).

With KAMP you edit the cfg, like most folks Im looking for settings (true, false, etc.) but at the very top whee most people placed
notes and comment them out, there are actuallly includes.  Choose those which apply and uncomment.

After klipper backup install:
wget -O ~/klipper/klippy/extras/gcode_shell_command.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/th33xitus/kiauh/master/resources/gcode_shell_command.py

Building the micro-controller with the configuration shown below. (If your klipper cannot select the following configuration, please update your klipper source code)

[*] Enable extra low-level configuration options
Micro-controller Architecture = STMicroelectronics STM32
Processor model = STM32G0B1
Bootloader offset = 8KiB bootloader
Clock Reference = 8 MHz crystal
Communication interface = USB (on PA11/PA12)
If you plan to use the USB to CAN bridge (only with M8P V1.1+) then use the following two lines instead of the above line:
Communication interface = USB to CAN bus bridge (USB (on PA11/PA12))
CAN bus interface = (CAN bus (on PD12/PD13))
